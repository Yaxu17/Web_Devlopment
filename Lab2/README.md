# ðŸŽ¨ Portfolio Styling â€“ Lab Assignment 2

This project continues from **Lab 1** by adding external CSS styling to the `index.html` file from the previous folder.  
All design and layout improvements are managed through an external stylesheet located in this **Lab2** folder.

- The CSS link in `index.html` should be:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../Lab2/style.css">
